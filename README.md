# Vyshnavi's README.md

Hi! My name is Vyshnavi Chunduru. I'm an undergraduate student, class of 2020. I've had two internships, both at MITRE, a federally funded research and development center in Bedford, MA. There I've worked on two web apps, and at my most recent internship, the tech stack I used was the MEAN stack. In July, I'll begin my first co-op at PowerAdvocate.

The purpose of this repository is for my computer science capstone, CS 4550, Web Development. A link to the syllabus can be found [here.](http://portal-cs5610online.rhcloud.com/#/)Currently, all it has is my first assignment, which is deployed on Heroku, and you can find it [here!](https://webdev-1summer-2017.herokuapp.com/) Soon, I'll have a project, which will also be here.
